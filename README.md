# ENSEMBLE

Early Newborn Study: Early Markers of a Better LifE (ENSEMBLE)

## Summary

In the ENSEMBLE study, 8 neonatal intensive care units from 5 different European countries collaborate to collect clinical data, EEG, MRI and long term neurodevelopmental outcome data in 1000 babies with confirmed perinatal braindamage. We will develop and validate a multimodal machine learning model to predict long term neurodevelopmental outcome, which could be used by clinicians as a decision support tool. Furthermore, the study aims to gain more insight in the parental wellbeing and needs through longitudinal questionnaires.
